The *.npy files with the processed data should be placed in this folder.

To train a particular model with some parameters, import autoTF and execute
the "compute" function. The first argument should be the number of layers of
the model OR a list with the size of each of the layers. The remaining
arguments are optional (see autoTF.py for more info).

The "compute" function takes care of everything.
